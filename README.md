Homework 2: Authentication Protocols

The purpose of Homework 2 is to evaluate and strengthen a security protocol that enables client-server authentication. 
The challenge-response authentication protocol operates through a method that makes it possible for both replay and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks to occur. 
The attacks are simulated by students who enhance the protocol through nonce integration while implementing sophisticated encryption algorithms.

Replaying previously used challenges through the challenge-response method gives attackers the opportunity to authorize unauthorized entry.

A scenario involves students performing attacks on the exchange between Alice and Bob as they monitor and tamper with their respective messages.

The security of the system is enhanced through the implementation of session-specific nonces in addition to AES encryption with HMAC authentication for securing messages.

Studnets write the secure implementation code in Python through which Alice and Bob perform protected nonce exchange.

The students conduct testing upon protocol deployment to verify its resistance against attacks through traffic analysis with Wireshark.

This homework allows students to experience encryption and nonce usage for authentication protocol protection as well as attack prevention methods. Through this process students develop better proficiency in both network traffic examination and secure digital communication methods.
